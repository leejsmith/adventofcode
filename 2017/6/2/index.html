                <p>Out of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop: starting from a state that has already been seen, how many block redistribution cycles must be performed before that same state is seen again?</p>
                <p>In the example above, <code>2 4 1 2</code> is seen again after four cycles, and so the answer in that example would be <code>4</code>.</p>
                <p><em>How many cycles</em> are in the infinite loop that arises from the configuration in your puzzle input?</p>
