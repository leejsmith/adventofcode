        <p>"Great work; looks like we're on the right track after all. Here's a <em class="star">star</em> for your effort." However, the program seems a little worried. Can programs <em>be</em> worried?</p>
        <p>"Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the <em>evenly divisible values</em> in the spreadsheet. Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation - most of us specialize in <span title="Bonus points if you solve this part using only bitwise operations.">bitwise operations</span>."</p>
        <p>It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.</p>
        <p>For example, given the following spreadsheet:</p>
        <pre><code>5 9 2 8
9 4 7 3
3 8 6 5</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are <code>8</code> and <code>2</code>; the result of this division is <code>4</code>.</li>
            <li>In the second row, the two numbers are <code>9</code> and <code>3</code>; the result is <code>3</code>.</li>
            <li>In the third row, the result is <code>2</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this example, the sum of the results would be <code>4 + 3 + 2 = 9</code>.</p>
        <p>What is the <em>sum of each row's result</em> in your puzzle input?</p>
