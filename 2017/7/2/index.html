        <article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The programs explain the situation: they can't get down.  Rather, they <em>could</em> get down, if they weren't expending all of their energy trying to keep the tower balanced. Apparently, one program has the <em>wrong weight</em>, and until it's fixed, they're stuck here.</p>
<p>For any program holding a disc, each program standing on that disc forms a sub-tower. Each of those sub-towers are supposed to be the same weight, or the disc itself isn't balanced. The weight of a tower is the sum of the weights of the programs in that tower.</p>
<p>In the example above, this means that for <code>ugml</code>'s disc to be balanced, <code>gyxo</code>, <code>ebii</code>, and <code>jptl</code> must all have the same weight, and they do: <code>61</code>.</p>
<p>However, for <code>tknk</code> to be balanced, each of the programs standing on its disc <em>and all programs above it</em> must each match. This means that the following sums must all be the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ugml</code> + (<code>gyxo</code> + <code>ebii</code> + <code>jptl</code>) = 68 + (61 + 61 + 61) = 251</li>
<li><code>padx</code> + (<code>pbga</code> + <code>havc</code> + <code>qoyq</code>) = 45 + (66 + 66 + 66) = 243</li>
<li><code>fwft</code> + (<code>ktlj</code> + <code>cntj</code> + <code>xhth</code>) = 72 + (57 + 57 + 57) = 243</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, <code>tknk</code>'s disc is unbalanced: <code>ugml</code>'s stack is heavier than the other two. Even though the nodes above <code>ugml</code> are balanced, <code>ugml</code> itself is too heavy: it needs to be <code>8</code> units lighter for its stack to weigh <code>243</code> and keep the towers balanced.  If this change were made, its weight would be <code>60</code>.</p>
<p>Given that exactly one program is the wrong weight, <em>what would its weight need to be</em> to balance the entire tower?</p>
